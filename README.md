# 🧠 SelfOS — Personal AI Wellness Companion

SelfOS is not just a habit tracker. It’s a private, lightweight, and smart system designed to help me stay on top of my nutrition, physical activity, mood, and health — with the help of AI and automation.

It combines:
•   ✍️ Natural input (CLI, Discord, or ChatGPT-style prompts)
•   🧮 GPT-powered kcal + macro estimation for daily meals
•   📊 Structured and persistent Firestore storage
•   🤖 AI-generated summaries, digests, motivation, and trend analysis
•   🍏 Optional iOS Health data integration (Apple Watch, sleep, activity)

This is my personal wellness OS — one that understands me better with each entry, and gives me insight and accountability without being intrusive. It’s built **for me, by me, with care.**
